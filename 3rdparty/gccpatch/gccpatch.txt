copy basic_string.h to TDM-GCC-32\lib\gcc\mingw32\4.9.2\include\c++\bits\
after installing all dependancies. 

This is a fix for C++11/C++14 that enables mingw32 to use stoul, stoi, to_string and many other string manipulation methods. Required for some modules in the framework. 

This patch is only required for the 32 bit toolchain, the 64 bit toolchain implements those methods.
