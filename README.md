# Crosswind
A modern C++11 Multipurpose library

Crosswind is a toolset that aims to integrate high level C++11 functions for different purposes such as fast GUI creation, Networking and Video Games.

The current supported platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac. Soon to come: Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry.

What the library has to offer right now is:

GUI
Events
Websockets
Cryptography
Filesystem utils.


The API documentation will be ready once multithreading gets achieved for all previous modules. Don't worry, it will be pretty simple.


What is left: 

Javascript, 3D, Audio, SRTP, Video, DB, Bindings with other languages.
